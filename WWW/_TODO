=======================================================================================================
- When we are FOE, we cannot enter a sector unless we attack it. Moving to a sector is possible,
  but we cannot enter to planets if we do not own any planets inside.
- We cannot move vessels to planets with status FOE.
- We can move vessels to planets with status FRIEND.
- We can move vessels to planets with status NEUTRAL but we cannot attack the planet while in orbit.
* When foe,
      you cannot orbit an enemy planet unless you attack it.
      you cannot enter a enemy sector unless you own planets in it. you can only go to your own planets.
      you can border a sector.
* When neutral,
      you can border a sector owned by user.
      you can attack planet owned by user.
* When friendly to user,
      you can border a sector owned by user.
      you cannot attack a planet from user.
    V you can setup traderoutes to user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Not done yet
  C Check functionality
  V Done
  U Unfixed or workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[TODO]
* Move all html/output into templates through Smarty: seperate html from php code: THIS IS A LOT OF WORK SINCE
  THE PROJECT IS GETTING WAY TOO BIG!! (so it's best to do it now before it's impossible).
* We still must do a F5/refresh before the themes go into effect... can we change this?
* Create an extra required parameter in sql_query: (int)(NO_NULL_ALLOWED, JUST_ONE_ALLOWED, MULTIPLE_ALLOWED).
  This is needed so we don't have to check each query for the number of rows.
V Make sure themes are adjusted in preferences/registration (commserver)
V Template theming: done by creating different templates/css'es into directories and using a theme_id
  in the u_users. This can be changed in the registration and preferences.
V Create a {comment}{/comment} block function for smarty.
V Maybe I should change the help-assigns into blocks. If i'm on the help-page, I only would need HELP_* links, not
  the rest so it's useless to load them all into the system: help_set_template_vars now takes a prefix
* Create {comment}{/comment} blocks in each template with standard information (CVS headers etc), variables and
  possible rarities of the template (same as message-main.tpl)
* Create in the invention screen like: 'xxx% until new discovery'
C Changed s_building.building_level into s_building.build_level, sync it.
C Changed s_vessel.vessel_level into s_vessel.build_level, sync it.
U Yapter: problems with IF/ELSE/FI inside (repeating) blocks: problem is not within the IF/ELSE but
  in the design of yapter :| Yapter sux.
V Find out if it's possible to created 'paged' versions of a template/page. This means that without any real
  trouble (maybe only calling 1 or 2 functions) we could get instead of a 200 row long table, we should get
  20 pages with 10 rows each, with the possibility to navigate through all the pages: Yes, it's possible with
  the {pager} function. However, we must supply $pager_pos to every template we want to page. This means the
  php-source has to be pager-ready(tm) ie: assign a pager_pos var to the template. This is merely adding 3
  line before displaying..
V Make sure all blockrows have a rowclass-variable which can set our <TR> class. This makes it easier
  to create simple odd/even colored rows: smarty does this already
U Move all html/output into templates through Yapter: seperate html from php code: THIS IS A LOT OF WORK SINCE
  THE PROJECT IS GETTING WAY TOO BIG!! (so it's best to do it now before it's impossible): Yapter cannot do
  everything I need. Moving over to smarty.
* Place Perihelion into a CVS.
* Create set invisible on/off in the preferences.
* $_USER should not be used in functions. Only take $user_id into the functions.
* Messages doesn't work all the time. Need to check it.
* create  alliance.php::create_alliance()
* Invention rates are still wrong on initializing of users.
* When registering, we should have our home_planet be discovered and set unknown to 0 so we don't
  need to claim it.
* When registering, we should have our home_planet set to our home_planet name we want...
* Maybe we should do no upgrades. Or should we?
* Change the whole creating and upgrading of vessels thingie
* See if the heartbeat daemon still works :)
* Get trade.php to be a little bit quicker.
* Make sure all PID's are changed into AID's. We don't really use planet Id's or $planet variables
  unless we are absolutely sure that it's a planet. Otherwise it's an anomaly because we can also
  build stuff on a starbase or other things like comets which move through the galaxy.
* If we do a areascan we only have to select vessels and anomalies from distance-5000 to distance+5000.
  Any other distance above that would not reach the scan area anyway so there is no point selecting them.
* Vessel_build ticks should not be 6, but s_vessel[ticks]
* Maximum number of weapons on a ship.
* After registering, make sure we have a nice return to loginscreen thingie...
* I don't get convoymove.php::show_owned_convoys()
* change px_ef_item.  Only use init() and fini() for creating and destruction. For movement between
  vessels and planets, use something else... Just what is it what you want to do?
* Scan for enemies at 5000 mark, 4000 mark, 3000 mark, 2000 mark and 1000 mark etc.
* If we change to ENEMY, make sure the other user also changes into ENEMY: make a function
  set_relation ($uid, $dst_uid, $relation);
* Heartbeat: use vessel_level to invent vessels
* 4 different kind of improvements... what are they exactly? :)
* If user is in alliance, then only the owner of it can set the relation to other people. If he sets
  somebody to enemy, all users in that alliance will automaticly set their status to enemy
* We have to check everybody who also is in this alliance. Make sure we set everybody to friendly, AND
  set them in the discovered list if not already done so...
* Don't calc upkeep on the fly, but generate it the same as population count in the
  execute_xxx_function()'s: [vessel|planet]_[fini|init]_0 for items that are [taken|put] onto
  a [planet|ship]
* Alliance creating and disbanding
* When creating new user: make sure the initial - welcome to projectx message is ok (priority?)
* When creating new user: make sure the invention_levels are ok (it still isn't)
* When creating new user: homeplanet of user should have their home planet name (it still doesn't)
* Set credits to a decent initial_credits
* Credits should be generated by planet, not by user in credits.inc
* Let happieness work: 100% = all give credits,  0% none give credits
* Let sickness work: 0% = no extra deads, 100% all die
* If we set people to foe, we should decrease the happieness rating. People don't like having enemies :)
* Mine sweeper takes out mines when bordering a sector, not orbiting a planet since we've already
  decided that an enemy vessel cannot enter a planet's orbit while beeing enemy..
* upkeep ores for vessels cannot be done. We need a home_id for each vessel so we know what planet's ore
  we can take away for upkeep: maybe don't use ore upkeep for vessels?
* You can unload to other peoples planet, but you cannot load from other peoples planet:
  and what's with traderoutes then?
* Random hijacking of vessels by the program.
* Comets: random anomalies which travels through the galaxy and sectors.
* If we get interactive with other species (flying into their orbit or something), send
  message to both parties about discovering a new species, and put them up into the g_knownspecies list
* When we have explored a surface, we can set the name of the planet even without any vessels in the area.
  This should not be possible.
* Power can become negative on a planet when we build more buildings at the same time.
* Give points to buildings so we can use it for scoring purposes
* Make sure our population get upgrade a little bit better. Start upgrade faster, end upgrade slower.
* Check if we could a intersector planet move. We should a separate move-type value in the vessel and
  queue tables i think.
* Make the caching functions use 5 or 10 caches instead of just 1.
  Should be doable. Impossible, but doable: use config.php::$SQL_QUERY_CACHE

Very Low Stuff:
U Can we erase all table borders and only use the wb and bl class: using CSS in the themes for that
* Remove all unused variables in the files
* Make sure the stuff works under other browsers
U Text galaxy for links users, maybe no galaxy at all : We can do themes now
* Describe all functions in the WWW
* Describe all functions in the heartbeat
* Describe all functions in the pxserver









- Unfixed or workaround:
U Alliance achievements: show people what the alliance already did: this is something we cannot automate very easily
U Add help_links all over the place, and fill the database up with decent help info: we should do this another time
U Building dependencies when we want to build inventions: it already does.. dumbass!
U In graphics map, make sure we clip or move the name of a sector in the map.
U We need to do something with an academy. Maybe we can use it to direct our building paths:
  we need to input credits into an academy to train people intro military, civilian or mining. When
  you train people into military, all military buildings and things will cost less than the other 2.
  Is this an idea?
U Only heartbeat should update or insert queries, except for the h_queue table, I think: not possible.
U Change in px_vessel all assert()'s for vessel_id from is_value into is_vessel: euh.. no!
U The echo() function should parse all strings and make a nice layout: we can use pxtidy for that reason.
  But beware: it means we have to write a parser.. which is a shitload of work.. :)
U assert()'s in px_ef_*: nevermind
U get_planet_items and get_surface are the same. Change one of them. No, we just leave it this way for now
U Make sure we get refreshed after preference set: images don't get refreshed because
  they can have the same name as before: doesn't matter for now
U Create a separate CSS for the pages: not really necessary for now
U Message.php: show avatar of sending user: we can't because we don't save the userid of the
  sending party, only the textual name of the race.
U Check if we can check non existing functions in the perl software: cannot find it :(
U Check all _POST en _GET vars in the php code.. use them instead of the global thingies...
  Basicly use: _REQUEST:   We use input_check() function for the vars.
U something with session_start().. what the f*ck???: Fixed it, but don't know how.. :(
U Starbases: what to do with it: At this moment, it's just a kind of planet
U Either use ALL hashes, or none.. but not half/half. If we do it, make sure
  they are done in a *NICE* way: we change it into normal vars
U Paramlist should be paramlist with a : at the end: Yeah whatever
U Show the number of droids in the mines at mining.php: don't do it. We can have
  more mining products in other galaxies.
U server: we can update the counters in the child,  but that doesn't update the counter in the parent of course.
  I think it's time for a little bit of shared memory... No it's not. We use mysql ofcourse :)
U Status() command in heartbeat server: basicly put all relevant info into the mysql h_info table
U When creating new user: add a headquarter to the home planet: why?
U Calculating vessel ticks in 2 different languages is crap. Can we change it somehow: nope...
U Try to get the manufacturing decent, weapons by weapons: basicly it is, you only need to put it into ships etc..
U When overpopulated, change status. When more capacity build, change status back, but we need to know the old status
  as well.. :(
U Message read/display confirmation: Why!?
U px_item and px_building: make sure we don't have to use AUTOLOAD, but if we can catch
  wether or not a function exist...  We can't... :(
U Make some OOP in the php code: no oop, but all routines are pretty much organised now
U A ship with only impulse motors OR get lost through a wormhole, OR cannot go through a wormhole
  OR should use impulse in outerspace (not recommended): why not? we can fly on impulse again through the other side
  of the wormhole back: vessel with impulse cannot see wormholes at impulse speed when moving vessel.
U create ore_names in galaxy_configuration ("Xellium", "Augon", etc...): did in constants.pm. Not in configuration for now..
U Sector.php is still to slow. Is there a faster way? Currently not
U Discovery of blackholes, nebula's etc, gaat dat wel goed? Does it show up correctly at our sector maps etc? Check
  later. Looks ok for now.
U Friend Foe Neutral: setting status done by RELATION()
U Weapons for battleships: pretty much done by weapon-inventions.
U increase maxload of the vessels with the vessel-level: no. Static in galaxy config
U Change the attack and defense strengths a bit, we want vessels to be 10'ths, and planets to be 100rds: dunno if this
  works..
U Credits are too low at start: they are. Changed in galaxyt_configuration
U Get the statement handlers in server.pl decent: not done
U Create new buildings in 3 trees: military, civilian, mining: have to think about it some more..
U Status() command in heartbeat server: basicly put all relevant info into the mysql h_info table
- Check Functionality:
C If a user is granting a request for an alliance, we should check if it's already joined another (pending) alliance
C When we build a headquarter, make sure happieness and sickness are set to 100, 0
C If we fly into outer space, and we encounter an wormhole end, then we fly back through it to the other side again.
C Move all hardcoded values to the database c_config tables on the galaxies
C Add 'priority' in the c_config. Make sure we use the entry with the lowest priority.
C Create wormhole stabilizers as an item when you can build SpaceDock & Exploration Station
C We only should use the vessel_science when we actually can warp and use impulse. (otherwise we already are on 50%
  impulse when we build our first ship)
C Check Happieness and sickness is set to -1 when we createnewsector
C Do something about speed at impulse.. (1% == 14620 ticks!?).. I think max ticks in a sector should be 200.
C Change item_count in manufacture.inc into configuration (just like max_building_count)
C On each tick, increase current strength until fully charged. In starbases you get 5x ticks, spacedocks 2x ticks and in
  vessel construciton stations 1x tick extra per tick.
C When generating images for wormholes, nebula's etc, make sure we use the correct picture indices
  (planets 0..15, wormholes 3..4, etc)
C General message board
C Make sure we move vessels from the correct database in move.inc Otherwise we might move ship id 001 from galaxy_001
  instead of ship id 001 from galaxy_002: we send galaxy_db with every server communication
C Change angle into integers. This takes care of the selecting floats in mysql.
C General message board: the level isn't regexed the way it should be (should be between 0..99999)
C When creating new user: vessel and space invention should be 0, upkeep_costs=0, upkeep_ores=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
C Make sure sql_fetchrow returns an error when $result has 0 sets.
- Fixed:
V Generate nebula's, wormholes and blackholes (depending on a random percentage or something?)
V Change g_vessels.type into g_vessels.vessel_id ==> s_vessels
V Black holes
V We should accept manual input in vesselmove.php
V When reach border of sector, check for user_id of sector, if 0, place own user_id on the sector...
V We should include range-scanning for ships at certain places
V comm.inc  if msg is not present, make nice errorthingie...
V Send messages to other known species
V Tag Lines in userinfo
V Get info from other users
V Change showusers.php into only show users only when you discovered somebody...
V When we fly to an undiscovered planet, we can click on the link in the "flying to planet 5" in the vessel view
  window. Here we can already set the planet's name before we actually are orbitting the planet.
V Move ores from g_vessels to i_vessels
V Scan sector ranges (5000 ly is a nice area)
V Upgrade should be relative credits, not absolute.. otherwise we spend 500000 credits for upgrading from 99% to 100%
V When we fly into a blackhole, record the ships lost in s_anomalies[population] where id=blackhole
V Place number of concurrent construction in database (galaxy::max_building_cnt)
V When we build something on a planet, we don't get a "OK" confirmationthingie...
V Change messages into categories
V Ships should do something: Make sure advanced and standard exploration works...
V Get heartbeat daemon working again
V Create planet-classes and make sure we can only build headquarters when the planet can sustain life.
V Create a nice register screen
V Let the warp or impulse speed of a vessel decide the arrival time.
V Check why we can have a 156% ore in stock, we probably must increase the max_ore_X as well.
V Set a maxload to the vessels
V Define planet classes properly
V Conview.php lets us construct and manufacture in N-Z class planets
V When flying through space, set the distance and angle correctly... Is it the delta now or what???
V Battle ships
V Nog steeds een beetje trubbels met the active statements disconnects. Disconnect function deleted... :)
V Show attack, defense, strength
V Better zoom function in map
V Server: when generating homeplanet (is_home_planet=yes), it MUST be a habitable class (KLM)
V Server: check why we have 0000 at s_sectors.sector
V When flying to other space, we get some screwups in the queuelist.
V sector.php doesn't show correct population settings for tamara prime
V What's the deal with the stock exchange? Dunno, removed it..
V Could we rename anomolies (wormholes, nebula's)? Yes we can now...
V user statistics and showuser info should be more or less equal. Change into 'objects' and change
  stats.php and showusers.php
V Change classtype into class in s_anomalies.
V Scan area should not show vessels in nebula's
V change Orbituarium into observatory
V What's the deal with nebula's? What is their purpose? Hide stuff? Yes it is.
V Changes all ores from database into lists (cur_ore_1, cur_ore_2 etc should be cur_ore: ore1,ore2,ore3)
V Change ores into constants: change ores
V Remove all hardcoded orelists...
V At sql_query, make an additional query to update the logout time/date for the user.
V Make sure update to perihelion.u_access works from user 185251
V Traderoute, only show planets when is_planet in the source and destination lists..
V Trade: when we apply for a destination, we should only select friends.
V Try to place all routines in nice global_*.php packages.
V Mutual friends.
V Change all print() into echo""
V On ID, also send current galaxy
V Quick html fixup
V Basicly, the whole create treaderoute stuff is screwed up... make it so...
V Cargo (not ores) in vessels
V Only stabilize/unstabilize wormholes when we add/removed first/last stabilizer
V Create short description that we can see in the list.
V Make sure we only unstabilize a wormhole when we have no more stabilizers in orbit
V Change the items and buildings into decent functions. Use 1 function for each item or building.
V Make sure our items work
  When we place something to ships and/or planets, check if it's got a special function
V TICK: item on planet, item on vessel,  building
V Maybe we could click on a coordinate in the graphic and zoom in to that point? (Don't do it!)
  I told you.. don't do it... Oh well.. it works now...
V Image of galaxy into database configuration
V Change calculate_xy in the graphics.php
V Check if the ores are correctly setup when we create a new planet
V create image directory names in galaxy_configuration ("images/001/vessels", "images/001/wormholes", etc)
V Building/Vessel create, Show upkeep and initial costs in separate windows
V We don't have to random() our logout_date, because we can do it only the first time we hit the query. Set a boolean
  flag to false afterwards and we're done...
V Filter out everything with '<' and '>' when sending to server in comm.inc.php: replaces into &gt; and &lt;
V Make sector.php and conview.php faster: done by checking how many planets we have in a sector inside a
  SQL statement first (count). If 0, then don't enter the function...
V Sector.php is changed. We use a lot of caching functions to make it quicker. Set ob_implicit_flush to no works
  very well also :)
V Check if we don't see the galaxy message while impulse
V Rename sectors when we first own them: done at sectors.php
V Set checksums in the encryptvars: you can only use the encrypted vars in the current connection.
V Manufacture create, Show upkeep and initial costs in separate windows
V scan: cannot see vessels decently.
V Shortcuts in vessel move
V Scale on the graphics: we can zoom indefinatly if needed.
V Change vessel['status']=='ORBIT' into vessel_is_in_orbit ($vessel_id) etc...
V When flying to outer space, we maybe should be able to see the destination
  distance and angle: dst_angle, dst_distance
V Change heartbeat into include-files.
V Intergrate server and heartbeat: all global *.PM's are located at the px_global directory.
V Check that all angles are generated as 0 - 360000
V Cargo should have a green and red button. If it's green, it funcions. If red, it doesn't function (maybe
  it's a vessel weapon on the planet).
V Make weaponry move from weaponry to planet IF it's a battleship. If it's a tradeship, we can only
  carry cargo. Make sure that our item_is_active_in_vessel works (it should check the vessel type).
V Show presets in the graphics.php
V Add/remove presets
V Do the angle/distance of planets a bit decent. We get a lot of troubles now with distance
  being 2 different things.
V Manual flight has problems with g_vessels distance / angle
V Inactive buildings, items and vessels are shown as the NEGATIVE ID NUMBER:
V do_items() should be faster: if cargo_ids is empty, we can skip it..
V Make abs() into active_or_inactive()
V In graphics: neutral sectors is white, enemy sectors is red, mutual friend are green.
V items in graphics.php like: names yes/no, vessels yes/no, sectors yes/no,  blackholes yes/no etc..
V don't scale wormholes before zooming, make sure we do it correctly...
V Change the menu, make submenu's into [ CREATE VESSEL ] etc...
V Alliance messages: only people on the alliance can see those messages
V Alliances: basic functions work
V Only show users from an alliances when we are part of it
V After we done a req as alliance-owner, we should not be able to req the same item.. Make it an error...
V We need bigger galaxy graphics (800x800 or even 1600x1600). This makes it much nicer when we zoom
  in: basicly do mipmapping
V Show neutral sectors in graphics.php | main.php: we have some sort of problem with neutral sectors.
  What's the deal with sectors that aren't neutral, friendly, enemy or alliance? Every sector should be
  one of those: they are.. some sectors have an user_id of 0, which means show as neutral...
V Show upkeep credits in stock & upkeep
V What the f is wrong with the mining??? Don't use the same names for different things....
V When can we join a certain alliance? When we have discovered one of their members of course...
V Remove all errors->ERR_QUERY_PREPARED (they don't work)
V Remove *ALL* old-style function callings (&) in heartbeat
V Status() command in comm server: status.inc
V Create decent info screen: done
V Load/unload gives some socket_error stuff.. what's wrong: nothing, we should check with '=== false' not just '== false'
V Build_level for s_inventions
V What's an alliance: an group of users who globally set friend/foe/neutral.
V Get heartbeat daemon working again: removed general.pm
V use CSL functions for all CSL items...
V Remove *ALL* old-style function callings (&) in server
V Make sure that all px_<blah> functions start with the Id of the thing we do. ie: px_planet functions
  always have $planet_id as the first parameter.
V ALL return values should be a errors-><whatever>
V All mysql functions should be in the correct px_<module>
V main page should be info.php, not main.php
V print_title:  description should be added to each page
V Message interception.. Sometimes messages can be intercepted by other users. In create_message() we should add this.
V Change alliance into a decent function
V Make decent asserts in the functions.
V Every function should return an - ERR_<whatever> status or -ERR_OK status. This way we can check if
  somethings happened during the function, and take appropiate action.
V Fill in all descriptions
V Set ERR_OK success   ERR_*  failure in the descriptions
V All is_<anomalytypes> should be placed into px_anomaly (yes, finaly we have our baseclass!)
V Change s_planets into s_anomalies
V Make for all UPDATE functions a px_mysql::update_blahblahblah function, this way, we can control
  showing messages and setting flags for users when certains things
V Set up descriptions in server.inc's and heartbeat.inc's
V The credits are set to zero when building: {costs} instead {initial_costs} given. Fixed with assert()
V create_building() and px_building::init_0 functions are basicly the same. (same goes with px_vessel
  and px_item): everything put in init_0
V global_user.php: +- line 36
V ID must preceed every other command in the server: made command priorities. High prio command
  cannot be executed with low prioriy. ID will set higher user priority.
V Change user preferences and data.
V Change all colored tables into classes.
V Make a manual command editor: admin/admin.php
V input_check needs mandatory parameters like: inputcheck ("cmd", "!sid", "uid", 0) means
  we can leave out uid, but we need a sid.
V Don't let the command be generated by aid,bid etc.. make sure we send a CMD at
  very GET-request  (*.php?cmd=blah&id=blaat etc): input_check() function created
V USENOCACHE and USECACHE constants for caching functions
V There cannot be any "global $userinfo"'s in functions. All user information should be given
  by the calling function with a $user_id. Otherwise we cannot use the same function for a
  different user.
V use "user_ourself()" instead of "userinfo['id']"
V userinfo() in alliance_showinfo() ?
V Check alliance_showinfo()
V create user_is_admin()
V planet_is_discovered_by_user should be anomaly_is_discovered_by_user
V user_showinfo() uses $user_id as a param, but also gets info from userinfo[]
V Create admin page where we can fill in encrypted values for GET-pages.
V Specie name should be in the g_user info i think, not a separate table: user_get_specie
  changed into user_get_race: only need to change all over the source
V Make a nice working admin page at admin.php
V users.php should be a row-menu where we can pick out users, do not show all users at 1 go...
V graphics.php: still a bit slow. Using sql's FIND_IN_SET function.
V change g_planets into g_anomalies
V change in database: all csl items should start with csl_*
V All functions that make use of CSL fields should use decent CSL-functions
V Somehow we can't create messages with the message::create_message function: $target should
  be uppercase instead of lowercase.
V Undefined subroutine &px_mysql::get_specie_name called at relation.inc line 49.
V admins should have more info when a query fails: fixed in sql.php
V sector.php is too slow: 4.56 seconds... lets make it under 2 at least: We now select a sector
  first, and then show it like we do with the users.
V Get all assert()'s right.. use "! isempty ($blaat)" instead
  of assert($blaat) for instance
V Create building_show_details(), vessel_show_details(), invention_show_details()
V img should be image everywhere, also in the database
V Make for all query functions a px_<module>::<dowhatever> function, this way, we can control
  showing messages and setting flags for users when certains things
V Make sure we use "defense" everywhere instead of "defence"
V Change forms: first form method, than hidden inputs, submit last with name and type as submit:
V All info should have their unit before or after (ores should not be just "1000", but "1000 tons" etc)
V UPKEEP on everything, with credits and with ores!!!!!
V Do prefs.php. It doesn't work anymore. IT works again, but the internal is still crap. Need a
  redecoration because it's something I need for other pages as well.
V check if we still need explode(",", ...) somewhere.. probably it's a CSL
V We don't use SQL::g_user/vessel_load. Use it or throw away: threw away
V If we refresh a posted form, we must make sure that it doesn't do anything.. give each POST form a
  sort of checksum which can only be done once: created perihelion.formid and
  form_start/form_end/form_check functions.
V Anomaly count in sector.php: big difficult query made in sector.php
V Convoys: basic concept is done.
V Add our own html-'language' so we can add html tags safely to our description: done at convert_px_to_htmltags()
V We should be able to add an description to a planets so we can make our planets a little bit more custom.
V input_check manufacture.php
V Get html fixed inside messages.
V Can we catch 2 get-request clicks? Should be doable by checking the encryption-checksum, the same way
  we do with the POST forms. Maybe we should forget the post forms, and only store the encryption-checksum.
  No, better yet, we don't store unless we want to store. That means we only store when we build something.
  This means we have a function call store_checksum() and check_checksum().
  No, doesn't work. We have a var called frmid which we take onto post-forms and onto get-url's. When
  present it will check it. Make sure we have frmid as mandatory in input-check().
V Get the vessels working again.
V No passing of arrays in functions! Only work with the passing id's. This still is working quickly
  because of the caching functions for the *_get_* functions.
V Get frmid field in every php page where we send stuff to the server. Already added the !frmid
  field into the input_check functions.
V Rename all the vessel functions into decent namings. I have no clue what each function
  does, and I created the damn thing...
V When registering, make sure happyness and sickness are inserted
V Make functions: user_get_[weakest|strongest]_[ship|planet]()
V get_vessel_array () should be checked. It's a copy from get_anomaly_array at this point.
V Create whoisonline.php
V create global scoring forms
V Create help screens
V Get delete messages working
V Create global $_CONFIG, $_USER, $_GALAXY arrays
V Modify all hardcoded URI's to configuratable ones
V Create a CSS file instead of hardcoded CSS inside the header: perihelion.css created.
V Change projectx to perihelion
V There should be no difference for a px-server between galaxy_001 and galaxy_002: modified. The default
  galaxy is now decided by the cdb-field during every communication.
V Make sure we only call debug_backtrace() on the right php-version level: used function_exists()
V Templates all creates automaticly all help-vars
V Added invisible-flag. Users cannot been seen in the whoisonline when this flag is set.
V Upgrade yapter with IF/ELSE/FI statements
