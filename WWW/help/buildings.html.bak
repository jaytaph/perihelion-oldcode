    <table align=center width=75%><font align=left>
    Depending on the state of your planets, you can create buildings on the surface. All buildings are categorized
    in three levels: military, civil and mining.<br>
    <br>
    Military: All buildings used for defending the planet. This also includes all exploration and vessel buildings.<br>
    Civil: All buildings used for populating and keeping them safe and happy.<br>
    Mining: All buildings used for mining operations<br>

    <table align=center width=75%><font align=left>
    <tr><td><b><font size=+3>Headquarter</font></b></td></tr><tr><td>
    You need a headquarter before you can add people onto your planet. You can only support a small number of
    people inside a headquarter so make sure that you add more space if you want your population to grow.<br>
    As soon as there are people onto your planet, they will start to multiply. However, as soon as people
    start to get unhappy or when epidemic breaks out, they will start to flee to other planets and it will
    decrease your populationcount and hence your incomes.<br>
    You can only build a headquarter (and therefore populate the planet) when the planet is capable of
    sustaining life. This depends on the planets class (only K, L and M classes can sustain life) and
    the percentage of water which has to be at least 50%.

    <tr><td><b><font size=+3>Powerplant</font></b></td></tr><tr><td>
    A powerplant produces energy needed for other types of buildings. You can see how many energy your planet
    needs in the planet and surface view windows. When there is enough power, the output will be in white
    letters. If you use more than 50% of the planets power output, the writing will be in yellow and after
    more than 90% the writing will be in red. You cannot build any buildings that need more power than currently
    generated.<br>

    <tr><td><b><font size=+3>Mine Station</font></b></td></tr><tr><td>
    A mining station does not depend on a headquarter and therefore you can deploy mining stations
    even on planets which are incapable of sustaining life. After creation, the miningdroids will start
    to mine all ores they can find on the planet. You can add multiple mining droids into a mine so the
    mining will be quicker. You can see how many ore currently is mined from a planet from the 'mining'-menu.
    Red means that ore is currently completly mined. Yellow means the ore is almost fully extracted and white
    means that there is still plenty of ore left on the planet.<br>

    <tr><td><b><font size=+3>Orbituarium</font></b></td></tr><tr><td>
    An orbituarium is a building that houses a large space telescope. With this, your people explore
    different planets in your sector and beyond. At certain intervals, your scientist will discover new
    planets. As soon as you found a new planet, you will have to travel to the planet with an exploration
    vessel so you can check out the planet. After you have traveled to the planet it will show up in the
    planet and sector view.<br>
    The exploration interval can be increased in the "science" section of Project X.<br>

    ADAS stands for Advanced Defence Against Scum. This shield consists of many sattelites in orbit which
    are linked together with laserrays. When a ship hits one of those laserrays all energy will be forced
    into that specific ray and therefore blow up the vessel. It is possible to deactivate certain area's
    of the shield so friendly vessels can enter the planet without being blown to bits.

    In this station you can construct small vessels. Because larger ships cannot break away from the planet's
    gravity, it's impossible to create those ships from the surface. when you have created a station, you will
    be able to create ships from this planet. <br>
